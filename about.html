	<p>I'm Ezgi Eriçok and welcome to my food blog. I'll try out new recipes and post them here to share them with the world. If you enjoy any of the recipes I post feel free to leave a comment.</p>

	<!--<p>I grew up in Denver, Colorado and learned to bake from my mother. After finishing highschool I started baking full time and selling baked goods at local markets. Now I work full-time at a bakery in San Francisco.</p>-->
